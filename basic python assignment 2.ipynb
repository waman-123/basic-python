    "Q.1-What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- The Boolean data type in Python represents a logical value, which can be either True or False.\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a Boolean value in Python, you can simply use the True or False keyword. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "is_raining = True\n",
    "is_sunny = False\n",
    "\n",
    "These statements create two variables, is_raining and is_sunny, and assign them the values True and False, respectively.\n",
    "Boolean values are often used in control statements to determine whether a certain condition is met. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "if is_raining:\n",
    "    print('Bring an umbrella!')\n",

    "    print('No umbrella needed.')\n",

    "\n",

    "When a continue statement is encountered inside a loop, \n",
